## `pygments-atom-styles`

This package provides a port of the Atom One Light, Atom One Dark, and Atom One Half Dark styles to Pygments.

Atom One Dark style colors were taken from: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/packages/one-dark-syntax/

Atom One Light style colors were taken from: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/packages/one-light-syntax/

Atom One Half Dark style colors were taken from: https://github.com/sonph/onehalf

Some modifications were made to convert colors into hex codes, and were matched as best as possible to the Pygments token classes.

### Installation

To install, run `pip install .` in the repository root. After installation, the styles `atomonelight`, `atomonedark`, and `atomonehalfdark` will be available via Pygments.
